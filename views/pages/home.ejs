                <h3> About the book </h3>
                <p> Swami and Friends is the first of a trilogy of novels written by RK Narayan (1906â€“2001), English language novelist from India. The novel, Narayan's first, is set in British India in a fictional town called Malgudi. The second and third books in the trilogy are "The Bachelor of Arts" and "The English Teacher". "Malgudi Schooldays" is a slightly abridged version of Swami and Friends, and includes two additional stories featuring Swami from "Malgudi Days" and "Under the Banyan Tree".

It revolves around a young man named Chandran, who resembles an Indian upper middle class youth of the pre-independence era. First, Chandran's college life in late colonial times is described. After graduation, he falls in love with a girl, but will be rejected by the bride's parents, since his horoscope describes him as a manglik, a condition in which a manglik can only marry another manglik and if not, the non-manglik will die.

The central character in this book is the financial expert Margayya, who offers advice to his fellow       townspeople from under his position at the banyan tree. He is a man of many aspirations and this novel delves into some level of psychological analysis.

Narayan in his superb style narrates the pr of his role in India's freedom struggle during his youth. Gita forms the staple of his life. He tries to act on the principles described in the great epic. Naturopathy forms the pivotal of his life and he even desires to publish his natural way of living in the form of a book, but obviously it is a futile dream as the draft has been gathering dust in the publisherâ€™s office for the last five years.
